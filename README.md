# About me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a frontend developer with experience in React, Redux, and Context. I've built a project with Next.js and used various CSS frameworks and written CSS styles from scratch.

I've also worked with external APIs and databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and Firebase. Although I have a basic understanding of PHP, I'm currently learning TypeScript and Node.js to expand my skillset.

Check out my portfolio website [here](https://pan-be.vercel.app) to see some of my projects.

Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in working together or just want to say hi!
